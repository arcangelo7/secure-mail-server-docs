# Secure Email Server Architecture

This repository contains documentation for a secure email server architecture implementation. The system consists of a client-server setup with secure communication through WireGuard VPN.

## Architecture Overview

The system is composed of two main components:

1. **Client Server (Internal)**
   - Runs Mailcow-Dockerized
   - Not exposed to the internet
   - Communicates with the proxy server through WireGuard VPN

2. **Proxy Server (External)**
   - Has a static public IP
   - Exposed to the internet
   - Runs Haraka mail server
   - Handles incoming and outgoing email traffic
   - Forwards emails to the client server using XCLIENT

## Setup Guide - Step by Step

Follow these steps in order to set up your secure email server:

1. **[Network Configuration](docs/network.md)** - Start here to understand the network architecture and requirements
2. **[Firewall Configuration](docs/firewall.md)** - Configure the firewall on the proxy server
3. **[WireGuard VPN Setup](docs/wireguard.md)** - Configure the secure tunnel between servers
4. **[Mailcow Configuration](docs/mailcow.md)** - Set up the internal mail server first
5. **[DNS Configuration](docs/dns.md)** - Set up proper DNS records for email delivery
6. **[Haraka Mail Server Setup](docs/haraka.md)** - Configure the proxy mail server
7. **[Caddy Web Server Setup](docs/caddy.md)** - Configure the reverse proxy for web access

Each document contains detailed instructions for its specific component and will guide you to the next step.

## Security Features

- Complete network isolation of the mail server
- Secure communication through WireGuard VPN
- Preservation of original sender IP and headers
- Minimal attack surface with controlled port exposure

## Testing Environment

This architecture has been tested using Debian 12 as the operating system for both client and server components. The proxy server was deployed on a [IONOS VPS](https://www.ionos.com/servers/vps), chosen for the following reasons:

- IONOS provides minimal VPS solutions starting at â‚¬1/month with 1GB of RAM
- IONOS VPS instances come with a static public IP address with excellent reputation
- The static IP significantly improves email deliverability and reduces the risk of emails being marked as spam

While this setup relies on IONOS as an intermediary for the proxy server, it offers advantages over dedicated SMTP relay services (such as [MailChannels](https://www.mailchannels.com/)). Although services like MailChannels claim to respect privacy by not logging email content and purging metadata logs after 30 days, they still collect metadata about senders and recipients, and potentially have access to email content.

By self-hosting the SMTP relay through a VPS, we maintain greater control over our email infrastructure. In the future, any hosting provider that offers static IP addresses with good reputation could be used, making it possible to move to a completely independent server setup while maintaining good email deliverability.

This guide was written after successfully completing this project. However, I haven't verified step-by-step from scratch that all the instructions in this guide lead to the desired outcome. There might be missing steps or room for improvement in terms of security measures and functionality.

I am absolutely open to improving these steps if:
- I missed some important security measures
- I overlooked critical functionality
- I forgot any important steps in the process
